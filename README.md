# Web Scraping for Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) Data

## 1. Overview
This document provides an overview of a web scraping script designed to collect data from a Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). The process involves sending HTTP requests, extracting relevant data, and storing it for further analysis.

## 2. Requirements
To run the script successfully, the following Python libraries are required:
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `pandas`

Ensure these dependencies are installed using:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## 3. Web Scraping Process
### 3.1 Sending HTTP Requests
The script uses the `requests` library to fetch web pages containing CEMS data. The response is parsed to extract the relevant information.

### 3.2 Parsing HTML Content
The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse the retrieved HTML content and locate specific data elements using:
```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
```

### 3.3 Extracting and Cleaning Data
- Identifies relevant HTML tags.
- Extracts text or table data.
- Cleans and structures the extracted information for further use.

### 3.4 Storing Data in Pandas DataFrame
The extracted data is structured in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Column1", "Column2", ...])
```

## 4. Data Processing and Storage
- The cleaned data is stored in CSV format using:
```python
df.to_csv("cems_data.csv", index=False)
```
- Additional processing, such as filtering or aggregation, can be applied as needed.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging
- The script includes error handling mechanisms to manage failed requests or missing data.
- Logs errors for debugging and ensures the script runs efficiently.

## 6. Future Improvements
- Automate periodic data extraction.
- Implement multi-threading for improved performance.
- Store data in a database for long-term analysis.
